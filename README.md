## OO Basics
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

## OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementation
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact

## OO Patterns
### Strategy
- Defines family algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independantly from client
  
### Observer
- Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
